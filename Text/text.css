 /* Wrapping and breaking text  */

     /* What is overflowing text?  */
    /* an unbreakable string such as a very long word, by default it will overflow any container that is too small for it in the inline direction.  --> */

    /* In this example - */

.wrapping{
    /* inline-size: 150px; */
    width: 200px;
    border: 2px solid black;
    margin: 20px 20px;
}

/* CSS will display overflow in this way, because doing something else could cause data loss. In CSS data loss means that some of your content vanishes.  */
/* the initial value of overflow is visible, and we can see the overflowing text.  */
.wrapping{
    /* overflow: hidden; */
}


/* Finding the min-content size */
/* To find the minimum size of the box that will contain its contents with no overflows, set the width or inline-size property of the box to min-content.*/

.wrapping{
    /* inline-size: min-content; */
}


/* Breaking long words */
/* If the box needs to be a fixed size, or you are keen to ensure that long words can't overflow, then the overflow-wrap property can help. */

.wrapping{
    /* overflow-wrap: break-word; */
}

/* An alternative property to try is word-break. 
This property will break the word at the point it overflows. It will cause a break-even if placing the word onto a new line would allow it to display without breaking. */

.wrap{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    gap: 40px;
    margin: 20px 305px;
}

.wrap .box{
    border: 2px solid red;
    width: 200px;
    padding: 30px;
}

.first{
    word-break: break-all;
}
.second{
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
}

/* Adding hyphens */
/* To add hyphens when words are broken, use the CSS hyphens property. Using a value of auto, the browser is free to automatically break words at appropriate hyphenation points, following whatever rules it chooses.
A hard break (‐) will always break, even if it is not necessary to do so. A soft break (&shy;) only breaks if breaking is needed. */
